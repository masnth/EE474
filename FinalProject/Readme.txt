** This is the final project for my class EE474: Intro to Embedded System.

  In this project, we make a portable electrocardiograph (ECG) monitor to ensure the health of human's heart. 
  Our main goals is to filter out all the noise to display intuitive diagram to user and to build a friendly 
  user interface with convenient features.
  
  This device uses the positions of P, QRS, and T waves, and applies several detection algorithms to efficiently 
  determine heart beat parameters so it can detect various type of arrhythmia diseases. The ECG successfully 
  measures the heart rate, various heart shape intervals, and determine three types of arrhythmia diseases namely
  Bradycardia, Tachycardia, and Premature Ventricular Contraction. 
  
  Extension features such as bluetooth compatible, LCD screen display, user interface (UI) menu and buttons to
  control are also included in the ECG device. 
  
  See the paper for more detail.
